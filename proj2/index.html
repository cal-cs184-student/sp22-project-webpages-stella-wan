		<h1>Project 2</h1>

		<h2>Task 1</h2>
		<p>
			De Casteljau's algorithm helps us find a single control point that lies on the Bezier curve. In 
			task 1, we implemented one iteration of the algorithm: given n control points, we will calculate
			the n-1 intermediate points by interpolating the two neighboring points out of the original n control
			points (using the input parameter <code>t</code>).

		<h2>Task 2</h2>
		<p>
			Applying the deCasteljau algorithm to Bezier surfaces involves invoking the 1D deCasteljau algorithm for each
			row of control points, and then applying the 1D algorithm again for the interpolated points of each row to reach
			a final point on the Bezier surface. Each point is parameterized by two variables, u and v, where u is the parameter
			used when applying the algorithm to each row of control points while v is the parameter used to interpolate the final
			point on the surface.

		<h2>Task 3</h2>
		<p>
			For a given point, we traversed each half-edge connected to that vertex (via repeated calls to
			<code>next()</code> and <code>twin()</code>). For each face that surrounds the vertex, we find the three vertices
			of that face and then calculate two vectors corresponding to two edges of the triangle. We then take the cross
			product of the two vectors to get a normal vector, scaled by twice the area of the triangle. Finally, we add all
			of these cross products for each face and then normalize the vector to get the area-weight.

		<h2>Task 4</h2>
		<p>
			We first retrieved the original halfedges, vertices, and faces. Since we do not need to create any new elements, we
			assigned the new halfedges (namely <code>ad</code> and <code>da</code> according to the image on the spec) to be the
			halfedges of the original edge that we are trying to flip from (namely <code>bc</code> and <code>cb</code>), and we
			assigned the new faces <code>abd</code> and <code>adc</code> to be the old faces <code>abc</code> and <code>cbd</code>.
			However, after doing this, we need to reassign all of the <code>next()</code> edges for all of the halfedges (if they
			have changed after the flip). We also need to reassign all of the <code>face()</code> of the halfedges. In addition, we
			have to change the <code>halfedge()</code> of the new faces <code>abd</code> and <code>adc</code>, and the halfedges of
			the vertices. In addition, we have to assign vertex a and d to be the <code>vertex()</code> field of the halfedges
			<code>ad</code> and <code>da</code>. We did not encounter any bugs here until when we finished implementing task 6, add
			we soon realized that it was because we forgot to reassign the <code>halfedge()</code> field of the new faces. Prior to
			implementing this, we wrote down what each field of each of the halfedge, vertex, edge, face structures look like before
			and after the edge flip to figure out what we need to reassign. That strategy helped save a lot of debugging pain.

		<h2>Task 5</h2>
		<p>
			We implemented edge split by creating one new vertex, six new halfedges, two new faces, and three new edges. Once
			the new objects were created, we reassigned each pointer appropriately. We wrote down the changes that need to be
			made to every vertex, edge, halfedge, and face before writing any code to make the process smoother. We also gave
			each vertex a name (a, b, c, d, and m) and named each halfedge according to its two endpoints, making the variable
			names easy to understand. As a result, we were able to implement this task easily without need for debugging.

		<h2>Task 6</h2>
		<p>
			To implement loop subdivision, we first calculated the new positions for all existing vertices and stored
			them in <code>Vertex::newPosition</code> as well as setting <code>Vertex::isNew</code> to <code>false</code>.
			Next, we computed the vertex positions for the new vertices, which we stored in <code>Edge::newPosition</code>,
			and then split each edge and assigned the newly created vertex their new positions. Then, we flipped each edge
			where one of its endpoints has <code>Edge::isNew</code> set to true while the other has it set to false. Finally,
			we assigned the <code>Vertex::position</code> for each vertex to their <code>Vertex::newPosition</code> that we
			computed earlier. We debugged our implementation by commenting out various parts of our implementation and testing
			each part individually, where we uncovered some bugs with infinite loops when splitting edges and with forgetting to
			reassign faces when flipping edges.

			With each subdivision step, the sharp corners become more rounded out and the cube becomes smoother.
			The cube becomes asymmetric because each cube face has an edge running diagonally in one direction, but
			not the other. We can pre-process the cube by splitting the diagonal edge on each face of the cube first,
			so that each cube face has two symmetric, diagonal edges running through it.
