			When <code>ks</code> is low, the cloth is more elastic; it stretches more and hangs lower at its
			resting state. When <code>ks</code> is high, the cloth falls much more rigidly, as if the cloth
			was made of a more stiff material.
		</p>
		<p>ks = 1000 N/m</p>
		<img src="part2/pinned2_ks_1000.png">
		<p>ks = 5000 N/m</p>

		<p>
			The density of the cloth also affects how the cloth falls. When density is low, the cloth is lighter
			and does not hang as low at rest. When density is high, the cloth appears heavier and hangs lower in
			its resting state.
		</p>
		<p>density = 3 g/cm^2</p>
		<img src="part2/pinned2_density_3.png">
		<p>density = 15 g/cm^2</p>

		<p>density = 50 g/cm^2</p>
		<img src="part2/pinned2_density_50.png">

		<p>
			Damping as an effect on how quickly or slowly the cloth falls. When damping is low, the cloth swings
			around much more freely and oscillates more before reaching a resting state. When damping is high, the
			cloth falls more slowly and faces more resistance as it falls; thus, it does not move around as much.
			The screenshot below shows the cloth in motion when the damping is 0, where the cloth keeps swinging
			back and forth and never reaching a resting state.

			For the sphere with different ks. The lower the ks value, the more downwardly draped the cloth is. 
			It feels like the cloth is very loose. At higher ks values, the cloth is draped down less and there 
			is more structural integrity holding the cloth up.

			Below are three screenshots of the cloth falling and folding on itself, using the default parameters.

		<p>
			At low densities, the cloth appears to be more flexible and flatten out, similar to paper.
			When density is increased, the cloth is more likely to fold on itself like a blanket.
		</p>
		<p>density = 3 g/cm^2</p>
		<img src="part4/selfCollision_density_3.png">
		<p>density = 30 g/cm^2</p>
		<img src="part4/selfCollision_density_30.png">
		<p>
			The spring constant <code>ks</code> also has an effect on how the cloth appears to fold on itself.
			When the spring constant is low, the cloth compresses on itself more, appearing more flat despite
			folding on itself more often. When the spring constant is high, the cloth is more rigid and tends
			to unfurl itself after it has fallen on the ground.

		<h2>Part 5</h2>
		<p>
			A shader program runs parts of the graphics pipeline, and outputs a 4-dimension vector for each pixel detailing 
			the color / texture. For the purpose of this project, we are looking at vertex shaders and fragment shaders. A 
			vertex shader modifies the positions of the vertices through transformations, displacements, etc and calculates 
			the normal, the tangent, and other values for the vertices. A fragment shader uses the information calculated in
			the vertex shader to decide a color for the rasterized fragment.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Blinn-Phong shading model determines the color of a point through ambient lighting, diffuse reflection, and
			specular reflection. Ambient lighting refers to the color of an object that is not under any direct light (but
			still shows color due to ambient light bouncing around the scene). Diffuse reflection refers to the color seen
			in objects under a light source. Specular reflection refers to a shiny glare when light hits at exactly the right
			angle for the camera to see. All three components of illuminance are added up to create a color that is rendered
			at that point.
