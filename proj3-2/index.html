			As the bounce number increases, we see more reflection in the spheres. For example, at ray
			depth 0, the scene is completely dark. At ray depth 1, the spheres are pretty much completely
			dark. At higher ray depths, the reflection becomes more and more apparent and appears brighter.
			We need more ray bounces in order to create the full effect of reflection.

		<h2>Part 4</h2>
		<p>
			A pinhole camera uses an infinitely small aperture with a sensor behind it, so light rays
			can only enter the aperture at a single point. This causes all objects in a scene to be
			in focus. A thin-lens camera model is a more realistic model that simulates an actual
			camera lens. Instead of an infinitely-small aperture, we have a lens with a certain
			aperture size and a certain focal length. We compute the value of each pixel by simulating
			light rays refracted through a thin lens. Objects that are at the focal distance will
			appear sharp, while objects that are significantly closer or farther will appear blurry.
		</p>
		<p>
			Below are four images generated using different focus depths. All images were generated using
			a camera lens radius of 0.2.
